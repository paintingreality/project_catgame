# The Creepy Cat People Christmas Card Game.
## Made by Paul Alcaraz for Project#1 .



### This is a memory card game for two players involving cats, their creepy owners, glasses, mullets, facial hair and ugly christmas sweaters. 

### This game was made with love, frustration, HTML5, CSS, Javascript and JQuery. This is a beta version (some timing and scoring bugs exist).




## Instructions
### The game is quite simple and requires memory. 

There are four squares on the top of the playing field that are randomly generated with four pictures of cats with their creepy owners. These four images will fade completely away within five seconds. Memorize what pictures showed up in the four squares, you will need to recall this information fast!!

Once the original four squares have faded completely away they will be replaced with  another four squares with the same four pictures as before in a new randomly generated order. These four randomly generated pictures will fade away completely after 20 seconds.

There are four pulldown boxes with numbers 1 - 4 directly under the second set of squares. There is also a Submit button to the right of the last box. 

Your will need to recall from memory the original four pictures with the square locations they appeared in. You will need to select the pulldown boxes under the pictures in the second row of squares to match the original square locations (1 - 4) of the pictures when they where originally displayed in the original squares. Once you have selected the pulldown boxes, click the Submit button. (note: the boxes are left to right 1, 2, 3, 4.)

Once the Submit button has been clicked Player Two will have to do the same task. Once Player Two has completed the round the scores will be tallied and the next round will start. Each player has 3 lives, first player to get to 0 lives will lose. The winner will win a year supply of cat food!! (Joking, just making sure you are paying attention!) Good luck!!
